## Phase 8: Error Handling & Fallbacks (Milestone 5 Part 2)
**Goal**: Make the game robust and playable offline

### Step 8.1: Implement Retry Logic
- Exponential backoff for all API calls
- Maximum retry limits
- User-friendly error messages

### Step 8.2: Create Fallback Systems
- Default backgrounds when SD fails
- Silent mode when TTS unavailable
- Predetermined scenes when LLM offline
- Local emotion mappings

### Step 8.3: Add Settings Screen
- `Project/game/preferences.rpy`:
  - Toggle SD generation
  - Toggle TTS
  - Model selection
  - Cache management

### Step 8.4: Implement Debug Mode
- Console logging
- API call inspection
- State viewer
- Performance metrics

## Testing Checkpoints

After each phase, verify:
- [ ] No runtime errors
- [ ] Features work as expected
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code is maintainable
- [ ] User experience is smooth

## Risk Mitigation Priorities

1. **API Latency**: Implement aggressive caching first
2. **Model Quality**: Start with simple prompts, iterate
3. **Asset Size**: Use .gitignore early, monitor repo size
4. **Live2D Compatibility**: Test motions early, have fallbacks

## Notes

- Each phase builds on the previous
- Phases 2-5 can be developed in parallel by different developers
- Keep commits atomic and well-documented
- Run tests after each major step
- Document any deviations from the plan
