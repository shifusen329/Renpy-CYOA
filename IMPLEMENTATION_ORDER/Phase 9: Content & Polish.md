## Phase 9: Content & Polish
**Goal**: Create compelling demo content

### Step 9.1: Design Demo Scenario
- 3-5 branching points
- 15-20 minutes of gameplay
- Showcase all features
- Emotional variety

### Step 9.2: Optimize Prompts
- Refine agent prompts for quality
- Add style guidelines
- Test edge cases
- Ensure consistency

### Step 9.3: Audio/Visual Polish
- Add UI sound effects
- Transition effects
- Text animation
- Music integration

### Step 9.4: Performance Optimization
- Profile slow operations
- Optimize cache lookups
- Reduce API latency
- Memory management

## Testing Checkpoints

After each phase, verify:
- [ ] No runtime errors
- [ ] Features work as expected
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code is maintainable
- [ ] User experience is smooth

## Risk Mitigation Priorities

1. **API Latency**: Implement aggressive caching first
2. **Model Quality**: Start with simple prompts, iterate
3. **Asset Size**: Use .gitignore early, monitor repo size
4. **Live2D Compatibility**: Test motions early, have fallbacks

## Notes

- Each phase builds on the previous
- Phases 2-5 can be developed in parallel by different developers
- Keep commits atomic and well-documented
- Run tests after each major step
- Document any deviations from the plan
