## Phase 10: Testing & Deployment
**Goal**: Prepare for distribution

### Step 10.1: Comprehensive Testing
- Full playthrough tests
- Save/load at every point
- Offline mode testing
- Performance benchmarking

### Step 10.2: Security Audit
- Remove API keys from code
- Implement secure config
- Check for exposed endpoints
- Validate input sanitization

### Step 10.3: Build Distribution
- Create builds for each platform
- Test on target systems
- Package with instructions
- Create user documentation

### Step 10.4: Create Setup Guide
- Backend configuration instructions
- API key management
- Model selection guide
- Troubleshooting section

## Testing Checkpoints

After each phase, verify:
- [ ] No runtime errors
- [ ] Features work as expected
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code is maintainable
- [ ] User experience is smooth

## Risk Mitigation Priorities

1. **API Latency**: Implement aggressive caching first
2. **Model Quality**: Start with simple prompts, iterate
3. **Asset Size**: Use .gitignore early, monitor repo size
4. **Live2D Compatibility**: Test motions early, have fallbacks

## Notes

- Each phase builds on the previous
- Phases 2-5 can be developed in parallel by different developers
- Keep commits atomic and well-documented
- Run tests after each major step
- Document any deviations from the plan
