## Phase 2: Live2D Integration
**Goal**: Get Live2D character working with emotion states

### Step 2.1: Create Live2D Bridge Module
- `Project/game/ai/live2d_bridge.py`:
  - Emotion to motion mapping dictionary
  - Parameter blending for expressions
  - Fallback chains for missing motions
  - Export: `get_motion_for_emotion()`, `get_parameters_for_emotion()`

### Step 2.2: Implement Live2D Ren'Py Integration
- `Project/game/live2d.rpy`:
  ```renpy
  init python:
      import live2d
      
  define ivy_live2d = Live2D("Ivy/Ivy.model3.json")
  
  screen live2d_character():
      add ivy_live2d:
          xalign 0.5
          yalign 1.0
  ```

### Step 2.3: Create Motion Test Scene
- Test each available motion
- Document working emotion mappings
- Create fallback chain for each emotion

## Testing Checkpoints

After each phase, verify:
- [ ] No runtime errors
- [ ] Features work as expected
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code is maintainable
- [ ] User experience is smooth

## Risk Mitigation Priorities

1. **API Latency**: Implement aggressive caching first
2. **Model Quality**: Start with simple prompts, iterate
3. **Asset Size**: Use .gitignore early, monitor repo size
4. **Live2D Compatibility**: Test motions early, have fallbacks

## Notes

- Each phase builds on the previous
- Phases 2-5 can be developed in parallel by different developers
- Keep commits atomic and well-documented
- Run tests after each major step
- Document any deviations from the plan
